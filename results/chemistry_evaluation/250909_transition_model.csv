,"For the position model, we evaluated all the predictions. However, here we rely on selecting a subset of reactions that are actually interest to our chemist. Noteworthy, we are not evaluating all disconnection points as we would get n predictions for m points. Given that a reaction is a local transformation (with multiple permutations of the reaction side) we are more interested if the model provides a valid transformation and not if all the transformations are chemically sound. Therefore, we ask per predicted transformation a set of yes/no questions:",,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Q1) Given the transition prediction includes a reaction template, does the reaction template capture the overall chemical transformation of the reaction?",,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Q2) Given the transition prediction includes a reaction template, does the chemical reasoning for the reaction template align with the underlying reaction?",,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Q3) Among the reactant predictions, is there at least one that provides a chemically correct set of reactants to form the target product? (yes/no) specify id",,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Q4) If the model predicts a chemically correct set of reactants, is the model's chemical reasoning for that specific set of reactants correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Q5) If the reaction was conducted in the lab, does the model correctly predict the set of reactants that were used in the lab?",,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Q6) If the model flags one of its own predictions as 'chemically invalid', is its reasoning for that assessment correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,
,Incorrect requires that they are flagged as chemically valid and are not correct reactants. We omit also templates here,,,,,,,,,,,,
